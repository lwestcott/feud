            <div class="subhead">Provide Public Safety &amp; Justice</div>
            <p>Counties help keep Texans safe and secure. County government plays a significant role in both public safety efforts and the criminal justice system in Texas. They keep communities safe by providing law enforcement, the court system, jails, and emergency preparedness and response services in the event of natural and man-made disasters. </p>
            <p> <strong>WHO’S INVOLVED?</strong> <br>
                County sheriffs and constables are on the front lines of public safety and the criminal justice system every day in Texas. They patrol the streets, prevent crime, catch criminals, operate and maintain county jails and serve as an arm of the Texas court system. 
            </p>
            <p> County judges, justices of the peace, county and district attorneys, and county clerks all play big roles in the state court system, too, which is largely funded and administered by county government. Through the work of counties, criminals are prosecuted and justice is served, wills are probated, guardianships are handled and so much more. </p>

            <p> When it comes to exercising your right to vote, your county makes sure this important step in the democratic process runs smoothly. </p>
            <p>No matter what  kind of election you’re voting in — for local school board members, or for your county officials, for the next governor or even the next president of the United States — counties make sure your vote counts. </p>
            <p><strong>WHO’S INVOLVED?</strong><br>
                County clerks and elections administrators conduct elections for all levels of government — local, state and federal. They register voters, keep voting records and track turnout. They set up precincts and polling places, and coordinate the workers and volunteers that staff them.

            <div class="subhead">Build and Maintain Roads, Bridges </div>
            <p>County government helps keep Texans and the Texas economy  moving. Counties build and maintain nearly half the roads in Texas. They also  maintain one in five of the state&rsquo;s bridges. </p>
            <p>Counties do more than spread asphalt and pour concrete. Many  counties participate in strategic metropolitan and regional transportation  planning to help move Texans and commerce efficiently. The transportation  infrastructure counties are responsible for connects Texans, businesses and  communities across the state and beyond. </p>
            <p><strong>WHO&rsquo;S INVOLVED?</strong><br>
                Among their many duties, county commissioners are  responsible for the construction and maintenance of the county roads and  bridges in their precinct. Many county judges and commissioners also participate  in metropolitan and regional planning efforts.

            <p>From your  birth, to marriage and starting family, from building a business to making a  will and leaving a legacy for those you love, counties mark your most important  milestones and keep your most important records safe. </p>
            <p><strong>WHO&rsquo;S INVOLVED?</strong><br>
                The county clerk&rsquo;s office maintains and  preserves the official and permanent records for the county, the county&rsquo;s  residents and the court system. Some counties even keep safe records that date back  more than 170 years, to the Republic of Texas era.

            <p>From making sure  trash is hauled away and not illegally dumped, to providing medical and mental  health care, ensuring the health and welfare of county residents is another  major area of responsibility. Counties can establish hospitals, emergency medical  service districts and set up 9-1-1 systems. They provide indigent residents  with health care in some cases, maintain medical clinics that provide  preventative care like check-ups and immunizations. Many counties also help  fund local mental health crisis services. County veterans&rsquo; services offices coordinate pensions, loans,  transportation and other help for veterans and their families. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>WHO&rsquo;S INVOLVED?</strong><br>
                The county  commissioners court makes decisions about funding and implementing many of  these programs, but the day-to-day work is done by various county departments.  Connecting with many county services is as easy as dialing 2-1-1 or visiting  your county courthouse.

            <div class="subhead">Emergency Management</div>
            <p>Counties are the  first line of response in the event of an emergency — both natural and man-made.  Counties are required to maintain an emergency management plan. These regularly  updated and rehearsed plans describe when and how residents should be evacuated  from an area. They can also include rules for curfews and access to disaster  areas, and plans for maintaining county services during a disaster.</p>
            <p><strong>WHO&rsquo;S INVOLVED?</strong><br>
                The county judge is  the head of emergency management in the county. The judge&rsquo;s declaration of a  disaster puts the local emergency plan into effect. The sheriff and constables  offices, along with other offices, may assist in public safety or coordinate  the continuation of county services through the disaster.

            <div class="subhead">What's a County?</div>
            <p>Counties have been around since before Texas became a state, and even before it was a republic. Under Spanish rule, the land was divided into municipios. When the Republic of Texas formed in 1836, those municipios became the ﬁrst 23 counties. By the time Texas joined the United States in 1845, the new state comprised 37 counties.  </p>
            <p>Fast forward to today — 254 counties make up the Lone Star State. In each county, a team of locally elected and appointed county ofﬁcials serves its community.</p>

            <p>Each Texas county has a team of locally elected and appointed ofﬁcials who work full time to provide hands-on essential services that make government work for the people of Texas.</p>
