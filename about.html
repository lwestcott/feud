<p style="text-align: left">I enjoy my job as a Web Services Manager.<img src="img/1a.jpg" alt="Laura Westcott" width="175" height="218" align="right" border="3" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I'm Laura Westcott, Web Services Manager for the Texas Association of Counties. I have many years of experience designing and administering websites. My hope in taking the Front End Web Development class is to upgrade my skills by learning HTML5, CSS3 and responsive design.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In my spare time, I love to travel, help rescue dogs working with Austin Pets Alive! and enjoying plays as an usher for Zach Scott Theater. I was recently married to my wonderful husband, Danny, and we live in Central Austin with two dogs and two cats.</p>
